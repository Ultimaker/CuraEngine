/*! @brief This describes a polyline which forms a closed path.
 *  @sa https://github.com/Ultimaker/CuraEngine/wiki/Geometric-Base-Types#closedpolyline
 *
 *  The path may be closed:
 *    * Explicitely, which means the last point is at the same position as the first point.
 *      In this case, in order to iterate over the segments, you just have to iterate over
 *      the actual points.
 *    * Implicitely, which means the last and first point are at different positions. In this
 *      case, to iterate over the segments, you have to consider an additional segment
 *      between the last and first point
 *
 *  The difference is made because it is easier to iterate over segments when the path is
 *  explicitely closed, but ClipperLib uses implicitely closed paths. It is also a bit healthier
 *  to use implicitely closed because there is no risk that the first and last point become different
