 *  @brief A Shape is a set of polygons that together form a complex shape. Some of the polygons may
 *         be contained inside others, being actually "holes" of the shape. For example, if you
 *         wanted to represent the "8" digit with polygons, you would need 1 for the outline and 2
 *         for the "holes" so the shape would contain a total of 3 polygons.
