/*!
 * \brief Base class for various types of polylines. A polyline is basically a set of points, but
 *        we geometrically interpret them forming a chain of segments between each other.
 *  \sa https://github.com/Ultimaker/CuraEngine/wiki/Geometric-Base-Types#pointsset
 *
 *  * Open Polyline : this represents a line that does not close, i.e. the last point is different
 *                    from the initial point (think of the U letter)
 *  * Closed Polyline : a closed polyline has a final segment joining the last point and the
 *                      initial one (think of the O letter)
 *  * Polygon : this is a particular type of closed polyline, for which we consider that the
 *              "inside" part of the line forms a surface
 *
 *  \note Historically, the open and closed polylines were not explicitely differenciated, so
 *        sometimes we would use an open polyline with an extra point at the end, which virtually
 *        closes the line. This behaviour is now deprecated and should be removed over time.
