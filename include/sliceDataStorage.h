     * The infill_area is an array to support thicker layers of sparse infill and areas of different infill density.
     *
     * Take an example of infill_area[x][n], the meanings of the indexes are as follows:
     *   x  -  The sparsity of the infill area (0 - 99 in percentage). So, the areas in infill_area[x] are the most dense ones.
     *   n  -  The thickness (in number of layers) of the infill area. See example below:
     *          / ------ -- /         <- layer 3
     *        /-- ------ /            <- layer 2
     *          1   2     3
     * LEGEND: "-" means infill areas.
     * Numbers 1, 2 and 3 identifies 3 different infill areas. Infill areas 1 and 3 have a tickness of 1 layer, while area 2 has a thickness of 2.
     *
     * After the areas have been categoried into different densities, overlapping parts with the same density on multiple layers
     * will be combined into a single layer. Here is an illustration:
