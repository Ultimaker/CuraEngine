/*!
 * Class that orders paths monotonically.
 *
 * This is a utility class that changes the order in which things are printed,
 * to ensure that they are printed in the same major direction. Printing
 * adjacent lines in the same direction ensures that they layer on top of each
 * other in the same way. That helps to make the entire surface look consistent.
 *
 * To use this class, first create an instance and provide some parameters as
 * metadata. Then add polygons and polylines to the class. Then call the
 * \ref optimize function to compute the order. Finally, print the polygons and
 * polylines in the \ref paths field in the order in which they are given.
 *
 * In the output of this class, polylines and polygons are combined into a
 * single list: \ref paths . Each path contains a pointer to the original
 * polygon data, as well as whether that data represented a polygon or a
 * polyline, which direction to print the path in, and where to start along the
 * path.
 *
 * The monotonic order does not use the Z seam settings. It is meant to apply
 * only to polylines. If given polygons, it will place the seam in the location
 * closest to the source direction of the monotonicity vector.
