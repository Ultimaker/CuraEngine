/*!
 * Utility class to reduce the resolution of polygons and polylines, under
 * certain constraints.
 *
 * This class implements a polygonal decimation algorithm which is meant to
 * reduce the resolution of polylines or polygons. This class provides several
 * methods to simplify different geometrical objects such that they can be
 * printed without buffer underruns in a 3D printer. The simplified results have
 * the following constraints:
 * * The simplified path does not deviate more than the Maximum Deviation from
 *   the original path.
 * * In variable-width lines, the simplified path may not deviate more than the
 *   Maximum Area Deviation from the original path in the area that each line
 *   segment covers (width * length). This does not mean that the line couldn't
 *   be moved, only that its width may not locally be adjusted too much.
 * * The simplified path does not contain line segments shorter than the Maximum
 *   Resolution, unless that interferes with the first two criteria.
 * * The simplified path does not contain any vertices where removing it would
 *   cause a deviation of less than 5 micron.
 * * The simplified path does not contain any line segments shorter than 5
 *   micron.
 * * Line segments significantly longer than the Maximum Resolution do not get
 *   moved for the bigger part of their length by more than 5 micron, not even
 *   if this would be allowable by the Maximum Deviation.
