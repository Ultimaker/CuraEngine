 * A class for representing a planned path.

 * A path consists of several segments of the same type of movement: retracted travel, infill extrusion, etc.
 *
 * This is a compact premature representation in which are line segments have the same config, i.e. the config of this path.
 *
 * In the final representation (gcode) each line segment may have different properties,
 * which are added when the generated GCodePaths are processed.
