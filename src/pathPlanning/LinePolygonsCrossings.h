/*!
 * Class for generating a combing move action from point a to point b and avoiding collision with other parts when moving through air.
 * See LinePolygonsCrossings::comb.
 * 
 * The general implementation is by rotating everything such that the the line segment from a to b is aligned with the x-axis.
 * We call the line on which a and b lie the 'scanline'.
 * 
 * The basic path is generated by following the scanline until it hits a polygon, then follow the polygon until the last point where it hits the scanline, 
 * follow the scanline again, etc.
 * The path is offsetted from the polygons, so that it doesn't intersect with them.
 * 
 * Next the basic path is optimized by taking shortcuts where possible. Only shortcuts which skip a single point are considered, in order to reduce computational complexity.
