/*!
 * Class for generating a full combing actions from a travel move from a start point to an end point.
 * A single Comb object is used for each layer.
 * 
 * Comb::calc is the main function of this class.
 * 
 * Typical output: A combing path to the boundary of the polygon + a move through air avoiding other parts in the layer + a combing path from the boundary of the ending polygon to the end point.
 * Each of these three is a CombPath; the first and last are within Comb::boundary_inside while the middle is outside of Comb::boundary_outside.
 * Between these there is a little gap where the nozzle crosses the boundary of an object approximately perpendicular to its boundary.
 * 
 * As an optimization, the combing paths inside are calculated on specifically those PolygonsParts within which to comb, while the coundary_outside isn't split into outside parts, 
 * because generally there is only one outside part; encapsulated holes occur less often.
