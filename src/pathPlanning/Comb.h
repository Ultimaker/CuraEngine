/*!
 * \brief Class for generating a full combing actions from a travel move from a start
 * point to an end point.
 *
 * A single Comb object is used for each layer.
 *
 * Comb::calc is the main function of this class.
 *
 * Typical output: A combing path to the boundary of the polygon + a move
 * through air avoiding other parts in the layer + a combing path from the
 * boundary of the ending polygon to the end point. Each of these three is a
 * CombPath; the first and last are within Comb::boundary_inside while the
 * middle is outside of Comb::boundary_outside. Between these there is a little
 * gap where the nozzle crosses the boundary of an object approximately
 * perpendicular to its boundary.
 *
 * As an optimisation, the combing paths inside are calculated on specifically
 * those PolygonsParts within which to comb, while the boundary_outside isn't
 * split into outside parts, because generally there is only one outside part;
 * encapsulated holes occur less often.
