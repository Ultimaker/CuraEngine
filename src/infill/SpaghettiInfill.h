/*!
 * Spaghetti infill is a type of infill which fills every so many layers, but extrudes as much filament corresponding to the total unfilled volume under the filling area.
 * 
 * A filling layer is inserted when a a pillar of infill areas is becoming too high, or when the angle between the filling areas is too shallow.
 * 
 * The filling area might be smaller than the actual infill area, so that we fill the pillar from a smaller top area.
 * 
 * Infill pillars can join each other if they are connected on the top. The total volume will then be extruded from the top.
 * 
 * Where the model spits into two from bottom to top, one of the top pieces will be connected to the lower part as one big pillar, while a new pillar will be generated for the other top part.
 * Which part the base will be connected to is arbitrary.
