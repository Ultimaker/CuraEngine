 * === BASIC SUBDIVISION ===
 * 
 * The line is generated from a recurvive subdivision of the area of a square into triangles.

 * Triangles are subdivided into two children like so:
 * |\       |\        .
 * |A \     |A \      .
 * |    \   |    \    . where C is always the 90* straight corner
 * |     C\ |C____B\  .       The direction between A and B is maintained
 * |      / |C    A/
 * |    /   |    /      Note that the polygon direction flips between clockwise and CCW each subdivision
 * |B /     |B /
 * |/       |/
 * 
 * The direction of the space filling curve along each triangle is recorded:

 * 
 * 
 * Each triangle is associated with the length of the Sierpinski dual curve going through the triangle.
 * The realized density of a triangle is calculated using the length of the Sierpinski segment,
 * the line width and the area of the triangle.
 * The realized density is compared with the requested average density over the triangle according to
 * the volumetric density specification of the user.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * === BALANCING ===
 * 
 * If for any single triangle in the pattern the total realized length of all/both children is less than the average requested length of that parent triangle,
 * the parent triangle would definitely like to be subdivided.
 *     (When dithering, we may subdivide at a lower threshold and a constraint may cause such a triangle not to be subdivided after all. See CONSTRAINTS.)
 * However, it might occur that one child then ends up with a requested length lower than its realized length,
 * namely when the other child has a surplus of requested length.
 * The error thus induced should be recorded.
 * Value will be transported from the child with a surplus to the child with a lack of requested length.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Parent cell realizes 10mm filament, but child 1 requests 100mm and child 2 requests 2mm.
 * Subdivision would lead to two cells with 14mm filament realized.
 * Cell 2 therefore obtains 12mm filament from cell 1, where 12mm is recorded as an error.
 * 
 * === CONSTRAINTS ===
 * 
 * When subdividing an AC_TO_AB or an AB_TO_BC triangle, the place where the Sierpinski curve intersects AB changes.
 * In order to maintain a connected Sierpinski curve, we need to subdivide the (respectively) next / previous as well.
 * A triangle is said to be constrained by a preceding AC_TO_AB triangle or a consecutive AB_TO_BC triangle
 * if the requested density warrants a subdivision, but the connected triangle is of a different recursion depth:
 * _______                                  .
 * \      |\                                .
 *   \⟶⟶⟶⟶|↘ \                              .
 *     \  | ↘/                              .
 *       \|/                                .
 * 
 *         ^^^
 *         constrained triangle
 * ^^^^^^^
 * constraining triangle
 * 
 * 
 * This constraint means that sharp changes in output density are impossible.
 * Instead the output density changes with steps of 1 recursion depth difference at a time.
 * When the input requested density has a sharp contrast, we should try to keep the error introduced by the consecutivity constraint
 * as close to the contrast edge as possible.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * === TREE VIEW ===
 * 
 * The problem is easiest conceptualized when looking at the tree of all possible triangles.
 * The final sequence of triangles which are crossed by the Sierpinski dual curve can be seen as a cut through the tree.

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * === ALGORITHM ===
 * 
 * The algorithm runs as follows:
 * 1- We create the tree of all possible triangles
 * 2- We decide on the lower density boundary sequence of nodes (triangles) to cross
 * 3- We dither by walking over the sequence and deciding whether we should subdivide one level further or not
 *
 * >> 1. Tree creation
 *       *************
 * - Start from the initial boundary and subdivide until the maximum recursion depth
 * - Look up the requested density at leaves and calculate the corresponding line length
 * - Bubble up the total requested line length from the leaves all teh way to the root
 * - Calculate the average length of the Cross Fractal crossing of each triangle and record it
 *
 * 
 * >> 2. Create lower boundary
 *       *********************
 * - Start the sequence of nodes with the starting triangles (We start with two triangles, which form a square)
 * - Iteratively push the cut downward toward the leaves of the tree, while mitigating sharp contrast edges.
 * Each iteration:
 * 1- Move error length values introduced by constraining triangles from constrained triangle to constraining triangle.
 * 2- (Use errors to) subdivide each node where the total errored value is now large enough
 * 
 * 2.1
 * From highest density cells currently in the sequence to lowest density:
 * - Calculate the difference between the actualized length and the requested length.
 * - Distribute this error over the constraining triangles.
 * - Cascade this error value further up toward the root when processing the next density of cells.
 * 
 * 2.2
 * From lowest density cells currently in the sequence to highest density cells:
 * - Try to subdivide the node / two consecutive nodes which share an AB edge
 *   * Use error from 2.1 to subdivide cells which previously could not be subdivided
 *   * Redistribute error to where it came from: cascade errors back down the tree toward teh leaves where the error came from.
 *   * Balance children: make sure each newly introduced child has a positive error value.
 *
 * 
 * >> 3. Dithering
 *       *********
 * From begin to end of the sequence:
 * - If the triangle (or pair of triangles sharing an AB edge) is not constrained:
 *     If the errored value is high enough:
 *       subdivide this/these triangle(s)
 * - Carry along the induced error to the next triangle in the sequence.
 * 
 * 
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 
 * By following the path along the middle points of each triangle the Siepinski Curve will be generated.
 * By following the path along the middle of each edge the Cross Fractal curve will be generated, which is the dual of the Sierpinski curve.
