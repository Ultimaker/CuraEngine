     In order to not recompute the new height value of previously removed
     vertices we compute the height of a representative triangle, which covers
     the same amount of area as the area being cut off. We use the Shoelace
     formula to accumulate the area under the removed segments. This works by
     computing the area in a 'fan' where each of the blades of the fan go from
     the origin to one of the segments. While removing vertices the area in
     this fan accumulates. By subtracting the area of the blade connected to
     the short-cutting segment we obtain the total area of the cutoff region.
     From this area we compute the height of the representative triangle using
     the standard formula for a triangle area: A = .5*b*h
