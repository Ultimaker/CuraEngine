 * Class for generating a space filling tree which consists of a cros fractal.
 * The limit of the fractal sovers the area of a square.
 * 
 * The initial line segments have half the width of the full square;
 * The next iteration adds line segments of half that width to the end;
 * because 1+.5+.25+... = 2 this eventually fills the square
 * 
 * The root of the tree is the middle.
 * 
 * The connected distance from a point to the root determines it's parent-child relation;
 * no child is along the edge from a node to it's parent.
