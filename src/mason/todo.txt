      - Manual with single variable
      - All sent, button on gui to select
  - Experimental region designation
- Refactoring / cleanup
  - Rearrange such that Mason writes the end gcode
  - Performance improvements to slicing
    - Making initial polygons blocked on segments ending on a vertex
      - Need to record when ends on a vertex and consider connected face's segments
      - getNextSegmentIdx could only look around correct edge if this was recorded in segment
- Bug squashing
  - Slicing making of polygons may not work correctly for small gaps in part
    - Stitching can reverse edge directions
  - Meshing can collapse nearby points
    - Mesh::findIndexOfVertex doesn't collapse consistently (discretization effects)
