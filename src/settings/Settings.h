     *  3. Otherwise it asks its parent settings container for the setting value
     *     and returns that. The parent then goes through the same process. The
     *     root of this inheritance structure should always have a value for all
     *     settings.
     *  4. If a setting is not known at all, an error is returned and the
     *     application is closed with an error value of 2.
